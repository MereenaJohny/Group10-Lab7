<h3>Dim Sums</h3>
<p>
    <b>  INSTRUCTIONS:</b>
    Dim Sum is the Chinese style of serving an array of small plates of savory and sweet foods, that together, make up a delicious meal. These feasts are traditionally enjoyed by groups of family and friends over long brunches, accompanied by piping hot cups of tea.<br>

These are served in no particular order, and the fun is in sharing the different dishes, and enjoying the variety of tastes.

<h3>Hot and Sour Soup</h3>

Bring the soup to a simmer.  Add the remaining stock, mushrooms, bamboo shoots (if using), rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, ginger and chili garlic sauce to a large stock pot, and cook until the soup reaches a simmer.

Drizzle in those beautiful egg ribbons! While stirring the soup in a circular motion with one hand, use your other hand to slowly drizzle the whisked eggs into the soup.
Season the soup.  Stir in the tofu, half of the green onions, and sesame oil.  Then season the soup with salt and black pepper (or white pepper) to taste.
Serve.  Ladle up your servings while the soup is nice and hot, garnished with extra green onions.

While the pasta cooks, mince the garlic and slice the green onions. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Once the butter is melted and bubbly, add the garlic and onions (save a few for garnish) and saut√© until they are soft and fragrant (1-2 minutes).
Remove the skillet from the heat. Add the drained pasta and oyster sauce mixture to the skillet, and stir well to coat the pasta. If your pasta is stiff or sticky making it hard to stir, sprinkle a small amount of hot water over the pasta to loosen it up. Garnish the pasta with any reserved sliced green onions, then serve.

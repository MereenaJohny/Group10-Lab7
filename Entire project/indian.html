 Indian cuisine is one of the richest and most varied in the world.
 It was very difficult to narrow this list to just 2 or 3 types of famous Indian
 foods and popular dishes! India has a rich and varied food history. Every single region has
 their own type of cuisine that has been fine-tuned over hundreds of years
 to suit the local palate and to also match the availability of regional
 produce.

<p>For a person visiting India for the first time, the abundance and diversity 
of food choices may seem bewildering and overwhelming to the senses. We have 
curated a list of  famous Indian foods that you must try as a newcomer to 
India, and included easy to follow recipes so you can make them at home.
 These include Hyderabad Chicken Biryani, Butter Chicken, Chole Bhature</p>
